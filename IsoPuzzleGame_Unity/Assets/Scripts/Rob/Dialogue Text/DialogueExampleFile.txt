EXAMPLE TEXT DO NOT USE! 

This shows how to set up a line of dialogue 

Name|Dialogue|Sprite Number (int)|Sprite to Change (PLRSPR)

IMPORTANT - Name and dialogue can be swapped round however the sprite number must be in the third part of the line
		  - You don't need to put a spirite number in for every line, only when you want to change the sprite
		  - To change the player's sprite, type "PLRSPR" into the fourth part of the line. leaving this blank will change the NPC's sprite

Button line 

A whole lot more complicated so it will need to be simplified in the future!

Example:
Choice A|Choice B|Choice C|BTN|21|25|46|57|58|102

Example Breakdown:
Choice A Dialogue|Choice B Dialogue|Choice C Dialogue|Call Request (BTN)|Choice A Start Line (int)|Choice A End Line (int)|Choice B Start Line (int)|Choice B End Line (int)|Choice C Start Line (int)|Choice C End Line (int)

IMPORTANT - Dialogue for choices A/B/C must be in component 1, 2, and 3
		  - The call request must be in component 4 with the "BTN" typed inside
		  - Currently all lines related to these choices must be in the same file however, this will be changed in the future (to a string array if you forget Rob!)
		  - Currenty you can't call any sprites, this will be changed to do so in the future
